# Responsive Web Design Project - Seif-01

## Overview

Welcome to my Responsive Web Design project, crafted as part of my initial lessons on responsive web design at FreeCodeCamp.

## Project Description

This project showcases a well-structured webpage featuring content aligned with the principles learned in the first lesson. I have incorporated fundamental HTML elements, including headers (`h1`), paragraphs (`p`), images (`img`), unordered lists (`ul`), and figures (`figure`). The design is consciously created to ensure responsiveness.

## Development Environment

- **Operating System:** Ubuntu
- **Terminal:** I utilized the web terminal and Git Bash for efficient file editing and seamless pushing of changes to my GitHub repository.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5:** For structuring the content.
- **CSS3:** Basic styling for enhanced layout and presentation.
