# Cat Picture App - HTML Basics Project

## Overview

Welcome to my Cat Picture App project, developed entirely with HTML basics. This project is an outcome of my initial lessons on responsive web design at FreeCodeCamp.

## Project Description

This cat picture app is a demonstration of creating a simple webpage using 100% HTML basics. It features a variety of HTML elements, including headers (`h1`), paragraphs (`p`), images (`img`), unordered lists (`ul`), figures (`figure`), and more. The layout is designed to be responsive and user-friendly.

## Development Environment

- **Operating System:** Ubuntu
- **Terminal:** I used the web terminal and Git Bash for efficient file editing and pushing changes to my GitHub repository.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5:** Exclusively used for structuring the content.

## Resources
